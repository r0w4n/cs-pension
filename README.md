# Civil Service Alpha Pension Calculator

This is a pension calculator that is hosted at https://civilservicepensioncalculator.co.uk and has been designed solely for the UK Government Civil Service Alpha Pension. It is not an offical calculator and is not affliated with the civil service pension scheme in any way.

# Assumptions

## State Pension

The state pension provided assumes that you are entitled to the full state pension and which is currently Â£9660 per annum.

# Limitation

## Whole years

All calculations are based on whole years and do not take into account any partial years.

e.g., if you are using the calculator on the 31st of December and are looking at added pension then it will use the whole of the current year in its calculations.

e.g., if you retire at 67 and 5 months it will not take into consideration the 5 months.

## Inflation

The calculator does not take into account inflation.

## Only Human

Although best effort have been made to make this calculator accurate, there may be errors in the code or in the assumptions made when writing the code. You should only use this calculator as a guide and seek professional financial advice when making decisions.
