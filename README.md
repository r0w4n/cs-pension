# Civil Service Alpha Pension Calculator
This is a pension calculator that is hosted at https://civilservicepensioncalculator.co.uk and has been designed solely for the UK Government Civil Service Alpha Pension.

# Limitation
All caculations are based on whole years and do not take into account any partial years.

e.g., if you are using the calculator on the 31st of December and are looking at added pension then it will use the whole of the current year in its calculations.

e.g., if you retire at 67 and 5 months it will not take into consideration the 7 months.

Although best effort have been made to make this calculator accurate, there may be errors in the code or in the assumuptions made when writing the code. You should only use this calculator as a guide and seek professional finacial advice when making desisions.
